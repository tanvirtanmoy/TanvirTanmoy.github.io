										 <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Tanvir, and I hail from the beautiful country of Bangladesh. Currently, I am residing in the vibrant city of Amsterdam, Netherlands, where I have been fortunate to experience a melting pot of cultures and ideas.</p>

        <p>My academic journey began in Bangladesh, where I pursued my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). This foundational period was filled with rigorous coursework, engaging projects, and a deep dive into the world of computing. Driven by a passion for software development and an eagerness to expand my knowledge, I went on to complete a Master's degree in Software Engineering from Italy, Finland and the Netherlands. This advanced education equipped me with a robust understanding of software development methodologies, design patterns, and project management.</p>

        <h2>Professional Experience</h2>
        <p>Following my academic pursuits, I transitioned into the professional realm, where I gained invaluable hands-on experience in data analysis. This phase of my career allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems, enhancing my skills in data collection, cleaning, processing, and visualization. I have worked on various projects that required me to analyze complex datasets, extract meaningful insights, and present findings in a clear and actionable manner.</p>

        <p>Living in Amsterdam has provided me with an exciting opportunity to immerse myself in a dynamic tech ecosystem. The city is a hub for innovation and offers a plethora of opportunities for continuous learning and professional growth.
